# DETR Learning Model Loss Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing the performance of a machine learning model, specifically observing different types of losses during the model's training phase. The types of losses examined include Total Loss, Cross-Entropy Loss (Loss CE), Bounding Box Loss (Loss BBox), and Generalized Intersection over Union Loss (Loss GIoU).

## Loss Descriptions

1. **Total Loss**: This is the overall measure of the model's performance. It's a combination of all the other types of losses. Reduction in Total Loss over time indicates that our model is improving its overall predictive accuracy.

2. **Cross-Entropy Loss (Loss CE)**: Used commonly in classification tasks, this loss function quantifies the difference between the predicted probability distribution and the true distribution. As this loss decreases, our model's classification capabilities improve.

3. **Bounding Box Loss (Loss BBox)**: Specific to object detection tasks, this loss corresponds to the error in predicting bounding boxes. A decrease in Loss BBox indicates that the predicted boxes are increasingly aligning with the actual boxes in the training data, suggesting better object localization.

4. **Generalized Intersection over Union Loss (Loss GIoU)**: This is another loss specific to object detection. It considers not only the overlap but also the shape and size differences between predicted and actual bounding boxes. A decrease in Loss GIoU suggests better accuracy in predicting bounding boxes in terms of both position and shape.

## Visualization

We have created a script using Matplotlib that plots these losses over the course of training epochs. This allows for a clear visual representation of how the losses evolve over time and provides valuable insights into the learning process and model performance.

## Future Work

In the future, we aim to further fine-tune the model and experiment with different loss functions to enhance the model's performance. Additionally, we plan to incorporate additional visualizations and statistical analyses to better understand the relationship between different types of losses and their impact on model performance.

## Instructions

To run the script, make sure you have the correct Python environment with required libraries installed. Simply provide the log file path to the script, and it will generate a graph showing the changes in losses over time.

## Dependencies
